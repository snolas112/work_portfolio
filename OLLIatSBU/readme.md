This folder contains examples of my work at Stony Brook University OLLI Program.

I created an entirely new template and format for the Course Catalog by using Microsoft Mail Merge, and an example of that document is included in this folder. Additionally, I wrote documentation on my process and trained my replacement so that future catalogs can also be created to this design.

I was also able to create our first "OLLI by the Numbers" fact sheets displaying revenue, member and instructor demographics, and participation data, using Excel and Powerpoint to create these. 

In my role at the OLLI Program I primarily used Excel and Word for reporting and creating documents, and Powerpoint and LaTeX for creating training presentations. All documentation and data was held over Google Drive, so I was also frequently using Google Sheets. I created Pivot Tables and views for office reference. I also introduced Mind Mapping software to visualize the program's timeline. We also accessed Peoplesoft and CampusCE for database records.
